I am a Full Professor of Computer Science (<i>Catedrático de Lenguajes y Sistemas Informáticos</i>) at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.uma.es/departamento-de-lenguajes-y-ciencias-de-la-computacion/?set_language=en), and a researcher at the [Institute for Software Technology and Software Engineering (ITIS)](https://itis.uma.es/en/home-2/), [University of Málaga](http://www.uma.es). I am also an Honorary Visiting Fellow in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk), [University of York](https://www.york.ac.uk), where I was a Lecturer during 2018-2021. Prior to that, I was a Senior Systems Scientist at the Institute for Software Research (Now [Software and Societal Systems -- S3D](https://s3d.cmu.edu/)), [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu). I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Málaga (2009), and worked as a postdoctoral researcher at [INRIA Rhône-Alpes](https://www.inria.fr/en/centre/grenoble) and the [Centre for Informatics and Systems](https://www.cisuc.uc.pt/en) of the [University of Coimbra](https://www.uc.pt/en). 

I work at the intersection of software engineering, formal methods, and artificial intelligence. Among others, my research interests include: software engineering for autonomous and self-adaptive systems, software architecture, applied formal methods, and cyber-physical systems.

I am also an affiliated researcher in the [Architecture-Based Languages and Environments (ABLE)](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~able/) research group at Carnegie Mellon University, and the [Trustworthy Adaptive and Autonomous Systems & Processes](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/tasp/) team at the University of York.
